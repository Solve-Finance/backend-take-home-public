# Solve Finance Back-end-focus Engineering Take Home Project

First off, thanks for your interest in the Solve Finance engineering team! This take home is designed to assess your coding ability and style, problem solving approach and ability to communicate and realize requirements all the way to a working product that could be launched upon the world.

We feel that this is an important step in your application process so please give it your best. However, we appreciate that we are taking otherwise valuable time from you and not everyone will get to the stage of receiving an offer. As such, please stick to a hard limit of no longer than two hours to implement what you can. This is out of respect for your own time and so that we can evaluate candidates equally. Don't worry if you don't complete the entire thing, just add some text or comments to indicate what you would do if you had had more time.

Thanks again; and don't hesittate to ask questions!

# Task Description

Our company's mission is to save people money on their debts. And to do that in alignment with their own interests rather than selling them off as leads or data to other companies. As such, we wanted our take-home to be topical and relevant to the type of thing you might do as an engineer at Solve.

Your task is to build a program that calculates a user's debt to income ratio and then bundle that as a single endpoint on an API that we can deploy. We will give you the relevant data and calculations. It's up to you to build the service.
